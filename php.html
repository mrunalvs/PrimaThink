                PHP can be embedded into HTML.
                PHP is an object-oriented language.
                PHP is an open-source scripting language.
                PHP is simple and easy to learn language.
                <h3>History Of PHP</h3>
                PHP was conceived sometime in the fall of 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. Early non-released versions were used on his home page to keep track of who was looking at his online resume. The first version used by others was available sometime in early 1995 and was known as the Personal Home Page Tools. It consisted of a very simplistic parser engine that only understood a few special macros and a number of utilities that were in common use on home pages back then.
